# Mobile Developer Coding Challenge


## Goal:

#### Develop a simple app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of unsplash photos

- [ ] Grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying.
- [ ] Grid should work in both portrait and landscape orientations of the device.
- [ ] Grid should support pagination, i.e. you can scroll on grid of photos infinitely.
- [ ] When user taps on a photo on the grid she should show the photo in full screen with more information about the photo.
- [ ] When user swipes on a photo in full screen, preserve it's location on the grid, so when she dismisses the full screen, grid of photos should contain the last photo she saw.

### Evaluation:
- [ ] Solution compiles. If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes, bugs, compiler warnings
- [ ] App operates as intended
- [ ] Conforms to SOLID principles
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative
- [ ] Commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand
